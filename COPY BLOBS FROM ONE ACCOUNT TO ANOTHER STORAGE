Azure CLI
The Azure CLI provides access to Azure Storage through the az storage series of commands.
You transfer blobs between containers and storage accounts using the az storage blob copy command.
Unlike the upload and download operations, this command runs asynchronously and uses the Azure Storage service to manage the copy process. 

AzCopy
The AzCopy utility was written specifically for transferring data into, out of, and between Azure Storage accounts.

1Q. You want to quickly upload the data in a collection of small files held in a local folder to blob storage. This is a one-off request.
You don't want to overwrite blobs that have been modified in the last two days. Which tool should you use?
Azure CLI

2Q. You want to transfer a series of large files to blob storage. It may take several hours to upload each file, and you're concerned that 
if a transfer fails it shouldn't have to restart from the beginning. Which tool is the most appropriate to do this task?
AzCopy

3Q. You want to move a set of blobs in Azure storage from one storage account to another. You want to organize the blobs in the 
destination account in different folders, according to the month in which each blob was last updated. You'll be performing 
this task at regular intervals. Which tool should you use?
The .net client storage library
